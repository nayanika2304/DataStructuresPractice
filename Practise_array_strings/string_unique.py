'''
Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you
cannot use additional data structures?

Best Practise :

Ask if string is ASCII or Unicode. Unicode requires more storage
ASCII has 128-character alphabets

Algo if we can use additional DS - Time complexity O(n) space complexity O(C)

if string length exceeds the unique characters
return false

else
declare an array for T or F for characters
iterate through the array of strings
if bool array has string return false
else
boolarray[chartAt(i)] = true

If we are allowed to modify the input string,
we could sort the string in O( n log( nÂ» time and then linearly check the string for neighboring characters that are identical.
Careful, though: many sorting algorithms take up extra space.
